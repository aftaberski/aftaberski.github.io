    <p class="emphasis">My Learning Style</p>
    <p></p>

    <p>For this post, we were supposed to take a quiz to determine our <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc Learning Style</a> and figure out how we can optimize our study techniques accordingly. Guys, I'm going to be honest about this. I found this incredibly frustrating. I'm not opposed to quizzes. I take those ridiculous quizzes online and I love them. I love finding out I'm more like Beyonce than Rihanna. I feel this is beneficial for me to know. But because I'm a curious person, sometimes I retake those quizzes to see just how well they're constructed, and I find out they're basically arbitrary! Gasp! So anyway, because that's what I do with quizzes, I did that with this quiz as well.</p>
    <p>Before I entered this program, I took the quiz (I answered it completely honestly) and got "Abstract Random" as my thinking style. According to the website this means I "organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments." I'm just going to tell you right now, this is not me. I wish it was! But unfortunately, I need some structure. So just as with all quizzes, I retook it today. And this time I got "Concrete Sequential" slash "Abstract Sequential" (I ended up with a total of 36 in each, with "Abstract Random" coming up close second at 32). This was very frustrating for me. It felt a little like just another arbitrary BuzzFeed quiz.</p>
    <p>Now, don't get me wrong, It's not that I'm saying these learning styles aren't valid, but I feel like the quiz aspect leaves a lot of room for error, especially since there are only 15 questions. However, I do think the 4 learning styles can tell us something! I just think I can more accurately identify my thinking style based on the descriptions as opposed to the quiz. Therefore, I'm going to self-diagnose myself as "Concrete Sequential" with a hint of "Abstract Random" (I do feel I learn a lot through reflection, it was just the "thrives in unstructured environment" part that didn't fit). Taking this with a grain of salt, this means I like to have a structured way of learning something, but also need some time to reflect to further organize my thoughts.</p>
    <p class="emphasis">Growth vs. Fixed Mindset</p>
    <p>Let's begin my quoting <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Maria Popova</a> on her summaries of both Fixed and Growth mindsets (based on Carol S. Dweck's research):</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">
      A <strong>fixed mindset</strong> assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which we cannot change in any meaningful way, and success is the affirmation of that inherent intelligence, an assessment of how those givens measure up against an equally fixed standard; striving for success and avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being smart or skilled. A <strong>growth mindset</strong>, on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, I struggle with having a Fixed Mindset. Sometimes when I have trouble learning something, I start thinking, "well I guess I can't do this!" which I realize is silly, but sometimes I do think that way. It just means I need to remind myself that humans have this crazy ability to learn new things! It doesn't mean I'm dumb or whatever, it just means I haven't mastered the concept <em>yet</em>, which does NOT mean I won't learn it ever. I just might have to teach it to myself in a different way, or even seek out help from someone who's already mastered the concept.
