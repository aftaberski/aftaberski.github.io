Why It's Time To Git GitHub

If you never want all your hours of work to go to waste because some lame-o accidentally messed with your file, then maybe it's time you met GitHub, Reader, GitHub. GitHub, meet Reader.

Honestly, I didn't really understand what GitHub did before this week. Nor can I claim that I fully understand what it does now. However, since I know more than I knew previously, I may have some info fellow GitHub newbs might find useful.

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a magical place online that stores your files! So maybe it's not Hogwarts status, but it's still pretty cool. It allows programmers (or anyone for that matter) to keep track of changes that are made to a file using git, a type of version control software. This nifty feature makes it real easy to revert to earlier versions of code as well as generally keep track of changes, so if something isn't working, you can always revert back to an earlier version.

One of the main benefits of using git is that it allows you to collaborate with other developers on a project. You can all work on the program together without everyone accidentally deleting someone's work. Everyone can just merge their code into one master program (which is usually called the master code)

Hold on, is GitHub the same thing as git?
Well, git is definitely a major part of GitHub. I read on Stephanie Writes Code that GitHub is to git what Dropbox is to a flashdrive. While this analogy is admittedly not perfect, it really drives home the idea that git lives locally, and GitHub lives online. In order to put items in GitHub, you have to push the items there, just as you have to drop files in Dropbox. To sum it up, GitHub lives remotely, and git lives locally and together they make sure your files are saved remotely and locally and all the changes are tracked

Why you should consider using GitHub
1. Can collaborate with others! The more the merrier
2. Tracks your changes, making it easier to revert at anytime
3. Makes you sound like a cool software engineer
4. You git the right to make lots of git puns!
