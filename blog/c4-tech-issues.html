    <h1>How The Tech Industry Is Perceived</h1>
    <p>NOVEMBER 22, 2014</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Alright, this week we're supposed to write about an issue that's plaguing the tech industry. Admittedly, I don't have a ton of first hand experience...yet! But one thing I do have experience with though, is the reason why I didn't major in CS from the get-go.</p>
    <p></p>

    <p></p>
    <p>The main reason is the CS just didn't sound appealing. I had a ton of friends who were CS majors and they're the best. Duh, or they wouldn't be my friends. But even they had stories that weren't great. There was a certain sense of cockiness and lack of interpersonal skills. There were basically no girls. There was lack of diversity. They didn't necessarily make it sound too great.</p>

    <p>That said, these comments were not the reason I didn't want to go into CS. Actually, let me rephrase that a little. Their comments were not why I didn't even <em>consider</em> computer science as a major. Ultimately, I just didn't see any reason why I should. It didn't sound fun or interesting. It didn't sound like a friendly environment.</p>

    <p>And the stories from some of my friends who had to take CS classes as prereqs for their other majors were even LESS encouraging. They said, the classes were suuuuper hard. The classes assumed you already knew how to code. My friends felt dumb. They couldn't keep up. (And I promise you these people I'm talking about are certainly NOT dumb and are more than capable of learning how to code). Ultimately, most of my friends ended up taking those classes pass/fail or switched their majors entirely. Like actually.</p>

    <p>According to <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">BLS</a>, "Employment of software developers is projected to grow 22 percent from 2012 to 2022, much faster than the average for all occupations. The main reason for the rapid growth is a large increase in the demand for computer software." This is great news! Now we just need to make sure we have people to take these jobs, which is why the perception of the industry is so important. More people need to hear about tech and think "Oh cool! That sounds like something I could be good at!" or even "That sounds interesting enough for me to try a class!"</p>

    <p>This is part of the reason why the diversity issue has become such a hot topic for the tech industry. Diversifying the industry will cause a shift in perception, which in turn will reach a new set of potential software developers. </p>

    <p>The good news is that the shift in perception is happening! <a href="http://time.com/2901899/google-made-with-code-girls-in-tech/">Google</a> recently put $50MM to help code the gender gap. <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/04/05/etsy-announces-a-50000-scholarship-program-for-women-in-technology/">Etsy</a> launched a Hacker School to attract even more women to it's team. <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com/what-we-do.html">Black Girls CODE</a>  "introduces computer coding lessons to young girls from underrepresented communities." <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/about-hmc/2014/09/24/harvey-mudd-launches-initiative-increase-diversity-computer-science/">Harvey Mudd</a> launched the BRAID initiative to encourage women and other minorities to join CS. With this diversification, the perception of the tech industry will slowly change. It just seems to be a matter of how long it will take.</p>
