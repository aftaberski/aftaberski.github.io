    <h1>It's Dev-initely A Bootcamp</h1>
    <p>OCTOBER 29, 2014</p>
    <p>Hustling toward a goal</p>

    <p>New York is super into bootcamps. Not so much in the military sense, but in the exercise sense. Since I happen to live in New York and am known to do some exercising, I have frequented Barry's on many occasions (through Classpass, naturally). While you're in class, you listen to lots of Iggy Azalea and Lil Jon and sprint and lift weights until you can't even think about moving another muscle. Fun right? All the classes are focused around a goal: your body. Teachers are always yelling at you to push yourself even further so you can mold your body into exactly how you'd like it to look. They remind you that you really do have the power to transform the way you look and the way you see the world around you.</p>

    <p>As it's name suggests, Dev Bootcamp fits under this bootcamp umbrella. You choose to put in what you want to get out of it. It's up to you to decide how you want your learning to progress. Just as pushing yourself to lift weights everyday makes your muscles stronger, studying and continually searching for answers will strengthen your knowledge.</p>

    <p>Not gonna lie, that's pretty friggin' scary because  you have to take responsibility for your actions, which in this case means only you can control the outcome of Dev Bootcamp. YOU have to figure out your learning style. YOU have to realize what you might want to focus more on. YOU have to hustle. You get out of it what you put into it. The "institution" is only there as a guide.</p>

    <p>This responsibility also opens up a lot of possibilities. Really exciting possibilities. You can accelerate your learning if you want to! We're really just all working toward becoming hireable "world class beginners" and that's what this bootcamp is set up to help us achieve. That's the real goal.</p>
