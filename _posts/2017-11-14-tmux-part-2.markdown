I wanted to jot down a couple more tmux commands I've been finding really helpful.

Create a named session! This is super helpful if you want to easily come back to your carefully organized windows and running processes without having to remember a seemingly arbitrary session number

```
tmux new -s session-name
```

Now you have a session called `session-name`. If you want to come back to it after exiting your terminal or terminating your ssh connection, you can reattach to that session name

```
tmux a -t session-name
```

Now it's like you never left your tmux session :)
